This paper investigates how common institutional investors (CIIs) adapt to technology shocks using China's intelligent manufacturing pilots. The staggered pilot implementation causes CIIs to significantly increase ownership in treated firms, reflecting strategic adaptations to changing industry conditions. Further analysis reveals this effect is heightened for firms with higher managerial risk appetite, reputations for innovation, and locations with stronger intellectual property protections, as these attributes amplify pilot benefits. The pilot policy contributes to firm risk governance and affects CIIs through market competition and corporate innovation channels. Also, our paper echoes that the governance effect of CIIs on firms reduces the risk of stock price crash risk and information asymmetry. Overall, our study highlights the decisive role of technology shock in common institutional ownership.
