Starting from the participation of party organizations in governance, a corporate governance model with distinctive Chinese characteristics, this paper explores how the participation of party organizations in governance plays a role in corporate risk prevention and resolution. Taking all A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2019 as the research sample, this paper empirically examines the impact of party organizations' participation in governance on enterprises' excess goodwill. The results show that the participation of party organizations in governance can effectively suppress the excess goodwill of listed companies in China. This effect works by enhancing the corporate governance level of enterprises, suppressing management overconfidence, and enhancing the level of corporate social responsibility, and this effect is more significant in the absence of external governance and the strong color of regional cultural risk preference. Further research finds that party organization participation in governance suppresses the positive economic consequences of excess goodwill, reduces firms' default risk, promotes the growth of investment activities, and increases firm value, suggesting that party organization participation in governance may play a greater role in corporate governance. This paper enriches and expands the research on the effect of party organization participation in governance from the perspective of risk prevention and mitigation.
