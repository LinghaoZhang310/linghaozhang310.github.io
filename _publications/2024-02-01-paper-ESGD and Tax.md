This paper examines the relationship between ESG rating disagreement and corporate tax avoidance using data from Chinese-listed firms during 2015-2022. We find that greater ESG rating disagreement significantly increases corporate tax avoidance, even after controlling for ESG scores. This suggests rating uncertainty influences tax strategies beyond ESG performance itself. We posit that rating disagreement signals financing constraints and declining competitiveness, prompting firms to cut taxes to increase internal funding. Channel tests suggest that higher disagreement is associated with increased financing costs and constraints and weakened market power. The tax avoidance effect is concentrated in firms facing a lack of external financing or competitive pressures in the industry. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the tax avoidance effect of ESG disagreement is concentrated in firms with poorer internal controls, lower surplus management, and less external monitoring. The results highlight an unintended consequence of ESG rating inconsistencies - heightened corporate tax avoidance. Standardization could mitigate this effect. Our study illuminates how emerging ESG considerations shape tax planning amid informational ambiguities.
