We study how bank liberalization affects analyst forecast accuracy using two interest rate deregulations in China, the removal of the cap on bank lending rates in 2004 and the removal of the floor in 2013, as quasi-natural experiments. Our results show that the analyst forecast accuracy for high-risk firms decreases significantly after removing the lending rate cap. In contrast, analyst forecast accuracy for low-risk firms increases significantly after removing the lending rate floor. Moreover, interest rate liberalization affects forecast accuracy through operational risk and information asymmetry channels. Furthermore, the impact is concentrated in firms with lower-than-expected performance, greater reliance on bank loans, and lower audit quality. Our results suggest that the impact of interest rate liberalization policies is transmitted to analyst forecasts.
