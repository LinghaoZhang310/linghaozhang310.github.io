"The 14th Five-Year Plan emphasizes that deepening the reform of the investment and financing system is an important measure to promote the formation of a market-led endogenous growth mechanism for investment. Using the construction of provincial and municipal online investment project approval and supervision platforms since 2015 as a quasi-natural experiment, this paper systematically examines the causal impact of the investment approval system reform led by the launch of the online approval and supervision platform for investment projects on the maturity matching of enterprises' investment and financing by using the staggered DID model. The findings show that the investment online platform significantly alleviates the degree of corporate investment and financing maturity mismatch. The mechanism analysis shows that the investment online platform achieves efficient linkage and coordination between investment and financing by suppressing inefficient investment and alleviating financing constraints of enterprises due to information asymmetry. Heterogeneity analysis finds that the corrective effect of online platforms on corporate investment and financing maturity mismatches is stronger among firms with strong demand for real investment and higher management risk appetite. In addition, the online platform helps to optimize the regional business environment, guides enterprises to move from the virtual to the real, and promotes high-quality growth in corporate performance, thus confirming the policy effect of this new practice of investment approval system reform in stimulating effective investment and value-added by enterprises. This paper provides rich empirical evidence for further optimizing the construction of the online investment project approval and supervision platform, as well as theoretical evidence and decision-making references from the perspective of investment system reform for the establishment of a regular communication mechanism between the government and enterprises, and for the full stimulation of the investment vitality of market players.
